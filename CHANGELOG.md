# Changelog

## v0.1.0

This is the initial release. The basics work: MicroSD boot, Linux, both Ethernet
ports, the RTC, DT overlays, firmware updates. The display and eMMC support are
untested and likely require work. Only a cursory skim of power management and
other peripherals has been made so far.
